# How to use

Just run sass-dup-finder.rb with the list of sass files you want o analise:

$ ./sass-dup-finder.rb sass/*

The output (not quite pretty yet) should be something like this:
sass/a.scss with sass/b.scss
equal selectors
#<Set: {".test_same"}>
different rules for .test_same
    ["width"]: 100px

It points you what selectors names the files have in common
and what difference they have.
